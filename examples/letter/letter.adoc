Dear editor,

We are submitting our manuscript entitled *"`On the creation of beautiful PDF files using yet another HTML converter`"*
to your *Journal of Incremental Software*, which we believe is the best indicated to publish this work
(now that every bigger journal has said no).

In this paper we present Asciidoctor.js PDF, a new framework for the interactive generation of PDFs using web technologies.
While many other software exist to produce high quality PDF files, they generally lack the cool packaging and novelty of Asciidoctor.js
(and by "novelty", we really mean "recentness").
At this time, Asciidoctor.js PDF already has one active user,
and we expect this number to grow several-fold after publication in your journal.

We believe that this new piece of software would find an important echo in your audience,
in particular among developers interested in the creation of beautiful PDF files using web technologies.
Please publish us pretty please.

[.closing]
Yours sincelerely,
